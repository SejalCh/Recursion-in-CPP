# Recursion-in-CPP

##**AIM**:To study about recursion in C++

##**THEORY**:

<p>A function that calls itself is known as a recursive function. And, this technique is known as recursion. First the recursive function is defined in a function outside the main function , that is known as recursive call. Then it is agian called in the main function.<br>
In this repository we made a program to find the factorial of a positive number which explains the use of recursive function or recursion. </p>

##**Syntax**:<br>
void recurse()<br>
{<br>
    ... .. ...<br>
    recurse();<br>
    ... .. ...<br>
}<br>

int main()<br>
{<br>
    ... .. ...<br>
    recurse();<br>
    ... .. ...<br>
}
